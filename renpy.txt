This game can be built by and played with using Renpy

1) Download and install Renpy here: 
https://www.renpy.org/

2) Place github project directory within a folder called 'Shattered Memories Prototype' in the renpy installation folder.

	- This is very important, as the game uses absolute pats rather than relative paths
